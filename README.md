    This is a project that I initially built in two days. The main functionality of the project is to log a user's application data (i.e. how far the user got in the interview process). The user can select from 4 radio buttons (application sent, phone screening, interview, and job offer) to log that application's final progress. My goal for the future is to add the ability for the user to add the company and title information for each application and dynamically render that list. Another goal is to add a status to the application as in-progress or complete, so that if the application process is still pending, its data is not counted towards the user's conversion rates. The user could then look up a specific application and change its status to complete when applicable.
